# CHECK

A `CHECK` constraint in SQL is used to enforce data integrity by specifying a condition that must be true for each row in a table. It allows you to define custom rules or restrictions on the values that can be inserted or updated in one or more columns. `CHECK` constraints help maintain data quality by preventing invalid or inconsistent data from being added to the database, ensuring that only data meeting specified criteria is accepted.
