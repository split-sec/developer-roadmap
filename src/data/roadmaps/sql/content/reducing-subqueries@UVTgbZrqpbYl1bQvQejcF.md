# Reducing Subqueries

Recursive queries in SQL allow for iterative processing of hierarchical or tree-structured data within a single query. They consist of an anchor member (the base case) and a recursive member that references the query itself, enabling the exploration of parent-child relationships, traversal of graphs, or generation of series data. This powerful feature is particularly useful for tasks like querying organizational hierarchies, bill of materials structures, or navigating complex relationships in data that would otherwise require multiple separate queries or procedural code.
