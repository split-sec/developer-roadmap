Being an interpreted language, code is executed as soon as it is written and the Python syntax allows for writing code in functional, procedural or object-oriented programmatic ways. Python is frequently recommended as the first language new coders should learn, because of its focus on readability, consistency, and ease of use. This comes with some downsides, as the language is not especially performant in most production tasks.\n\nVisit the following resources to learn more:",

    "description": "A process is an instance of a computer program that is being executed. Each process is identified by a unique number called a process ID (PID). A process is a running program. The operating system tracks processes through the use of process identifiers. A process identifier (PID) is a unique number that identifies a specific process. A PID is automatically assigned to each process when it is created on the system.\n\nThere are several linux commands that can be used to monitor processes. The most common ones are:\n\n*   `ps` - report a snapshot of the current processes.\n*   `top` - display Linux processes.\n*   `htop` - interactive process viewer.\n*   `atop` - advanced interactive monitor to view the load on a Linux system.\n*   `lsof` - list open files.\n\nThe `ps` utility displays a header line, followed by lines containing information about all of your processes that have controlling terminals.\n\n*   [@article@ps Documentation](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/ps.1.html)\n*   [@article@ps Cheat Sheet](https://www.sysadmin.md/ps-cheatsheet.html)\n*   [@video@Linux Crash Course - The ps Command](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYwGNgsfN3I)\n\nThe `top` program periodically displays a sorted list of system processes. The default sorting key is pid, but other keys can be used instead. Various output options are available.\n\n*   [@article@top Documentation](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/top.1.html)\n*   [@article@top Cheat Sheet](https://gist.github.com/ericandrewlewis/4983670c508b2f6b181703df43438c37)\n\nhtop is a cross-platform ncurses-based process. It is similar to top, but allows you to scroll vertically and horizontally, and interact using a pointing device (mouse).

Chef \"Recipes\" are written in Ruby, in a primarily [declarative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_programming) style.\n\nChef requires that a client is installed on a server being managed. This client polls a Chef-Server regularly, to determine what its configuration should be. Chef-Solo is also available, a version of Chef that allows provisioning of a single node by running chef locally.\n\nA key tenet of Chef recipe design is the concept of [idempotence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idempotence). All Chef recipes should be runnable multiple times and produce the same result - this is especially necessary in cases where the client/server model listed above is in use. This pattern of configuration management is highly influential for future declarative tools like Terraform and Cloud Formation.\n\nVisit the following resources to learn more:",

Examples of secret stores include Hashicorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, and Google Cloud Secret Manager.\n*   Encryption: Secrets can be encrypted using a variety of encryption algorithms and protocols, such as AES, RSA, and PGP. Encrypted secrets can be stored in a variety of locations, such as a file system, a database, or a cloud storage service.\n*   Access controls: Access to secrets should be restricted to only those users or systems that need them, using techniques such as role-based access controls, multi-factor authentication, and least privilege principles.\n\nEffective secret management is essential for maintaining the security and integrity of a DevOps environment. It is important to regularly review and update secret management practices to ensure that secrets are being stored and managed securely.\n\nVisit the following resources to learn more:",

Availability can be affected by hardware or software errors, infrastructure problems, malicious attacks, and system load. Many cloud providers typically offer their users a service level agreement (SLA) that specifies the exact percentages of promised uptime/downtime. Availability is related to reliability in this sense. For example, a company might promise 99.99% uptime for their services.\n\nTo achieve high levels of uptime, it is important to eliminate single points of failure so that a single device failure does not disrupt the entire service. High availability in the cloud is often achieved by creating clusters. Clusters are groups of devices (such as servers) that all have access to the same shared storage and function as one single server to provide uninterrupted availability. This way, if one server goes down, the others are able to pick up the load until it comes back online. Clusters can range from two servers to even multiple buildings of servers.\n\nVisit the following resources to learn more:",

    "description": "Kubernetes is an [open source](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes) container management platform, and the dominant product in this space. Using Kubernetes, teams can deploy images across multiple underlying hosts, defining their desired availability, deployment logic, and scaling logic in YAML. Kubernetes evolved from Borg, an internal Google platform used to provision and allocate compute resources (similar to the Autopilot and Aquaman systems of Microsoft Azure).\n\nThe popularity of Kubernetes has made it an increasingly important skill for the DevOps Engineer and has triggered the creation of Platform teams across the industry. These Platform engineering teams often exist with the sole purpose of making Kubernetes approachable and usable for their product development colleagues.\n\nVisit the following resources to learn more:",
